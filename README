Installation
============

Configuration
-------------

  $ ./configure --help
  $ ./configure

Before running 'make' verify that all features you want have been
configured (see lines after 'Configuration:'). You need to install
development versions of the dependencies.

For example if you want to use 'mad' input plugin (mp3) you need to
install libmad0-dev (Debian) or libmad-devel (RPM) package. After
installing dependencies you need to run ./configure again, of course.

If you want to use the Tremor library as alternative for decoding
Ogg/Vorbis files you have to pass --with-tremor to the configure script:

  $ ./configure --enable-vorbis --with-tremor

The Tremor library is supposed to be used on hardware that has no FPU.

Building
--------

  $ make

Or on some BSD systems you need to explicitly use GNU make:

  $ gmake

Installation
------------

  $ make install install-man

To install HTML versions of the man pages:

  $ make install-html

Or to install to a temporary directory:

  $ make DESTDIR=/tmp/cmus install install-man

This is useful when creating binary packages.

Remember to replace 'make' with 'gmake' if needed.


Mailing List
============

To subscribe to cmus-devel@lists.sourceforge.net visit

  http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cmus-devel

The list is open (you can post to the list without subscribing).


Reporting Bugs
==============

After a crash send bug report with last lines of /tmp/cmus-debug to
cmus-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.  /tmp/cmus-debug file exists only if
you configured cmus with maximum debug level (./configure --debug=2).
