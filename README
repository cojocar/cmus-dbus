Installation
============

Configuration
-------------

List available optional features

  $ ./configure --help

Auto-detect everything

  $ ./configure

To disable some feature, arts for example, and install to $HOME run

  $ ./configure prefix=$HOME CONFIG_ARTS=n

After running configure you can see from the generated config.mk file
what features have been configured in (see the CONFIG_* options).

NOTE: For some distributions you need to install development versions
of the dependencies.  For example if you want to use 'mad' input plugin
(mp3) you need to install libmad0-dev (Debian) or libmad-devel (RPM)
package. After installing dependencies you need to run ./configure
again, of course.

If you want to use the Tremor library as alternative for decoding
Ogg/Vorbis files you have to pass CONFIG_TREMOR=y to the configure
script:

  $ ./configure CONFIG_VORBIS=y CONFIG_TREMOR=y

The Tremor library is supposed to be used on hardware that has no FPU.

Building
--------

  $ make

Or on some BSD systems you need to explicitly use GNU make:

  $ gmake

Installation
------------

  $ make install

Or to install to a temporary directory:

  $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/cmus

This is useful when creating binary packages.

Remember to replace 'make' with 'gmake' if needed.


Mailing List
============

To subscribe to cmus-devel@lists.sourceforge.net visit

  http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cmus-devel

The list is open (you can post to the list without subscribing).


Reporting Bugs
==============

After a crash send bug report with last lines of /tmp/cmus-debug (or
$TMPDIR/cmus-debug) to cmus-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.  The file
exists only if you configured cmus with maximum debug level
(./configure DEBUG=2).
