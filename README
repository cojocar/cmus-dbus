Installation
============

./configure --help
./configure
make help
make
make install


Documentation
=============

See $datadir/cmus/doc/cmus.html (e.g. /usr/share/cmus/doc/cmus.html).

Known Problems
==============

According to the README file included in libmodplug, it should
understand following compressed mods:

    zip:  mdz,  s3z,  xmz,  itz
    rar:  mdr,  s3r,  xmr,  itr
    gzip: mdgz, s3gz, xmgz, itgz

But I've not been able to play any compressed mods. Uncompressed mods
play without problems.

Reporting Bugs
==============

After a crash send bug report with last lines of /tmp/cmus-debug to
tihirvon@ee.oulu.fi.  /tmp/cmus-debug file exists only if you configured
cmus with maximum debug level (./configure DEBUG=2).
