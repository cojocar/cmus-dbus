Installation
============

Configuration
-------------

  ./configure --help
  ./configure

Before running 'make' verify that all features you want have been
configured (see lines after 'Configuration:'). You need to install
development versions of the dependencies.

For example if you want to use 'mad' input plugin (mp3) you need to
install libmad0-dev (Debian) or libmad-devel (RPM) package. After
installing dependencies you need to run ./configure again, of course.

If you want to use the Tremor library as alternative for decoding
Ogg/Vorbis files you have to pass --with-tremor to the configure script:

  ./configure --enable-vorbis --with-tremor

The Tremor library is supposed to be used on hardware that has no FPU.

Building
--------

  make

Or on some BSD systems you need to explicitly use GNU make:

  gmake 

To build optional HTML documentation (requires rst2html):

  make html

Installation
------------

  make install

Or to install to a temporary directory:

  make DESTDIR=/tmp/cmus install

This is useful when creating binary packages.

To install optional HTML documentation:

  make install-html

Remember to replace 'make' with 'gmake' if needed.


Known Problems
==============

According to the README file included in libmodplug, it should
understand following compressed mods:

    zip:  mdz,  s3z,  xmz,  itz
    rar:  mdr,  s3r,  xmr,  itr
    gzip: mdgz, s3gz, xmgz, itgz

But I've not been able to play any compressed mods. Uncompressed mods
play without problems.


Reporting Bugs
==============

After a crash send bug report with last lines of /tmp/cmus-debug to
tihirvon@gmail.com.  /tmp/cmus-debug file exists only if you configured
cmus with maximum debug level (./configure --debug=2).

Also it would be good to know what OS/distribution/kernel you are using,
so please include output of 'uname -a' command in the bug report.
