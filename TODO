playlist
 - use different color for tracks that will not be played in artist and album modes?
   also for unrecognized files in the directory browser
 - automatic reshuffle after all tracks have been played
 - automatic rating system
   - sort by rating
   - enqueue best/worst rated

output layer
 - mixer should be opened/closed when pcm is opened/closed
   to prevent mixer from controlling wrong subdevice.
   this does not fix the case when player is stopped and some other
   program 'steals' the pcm device from us.
